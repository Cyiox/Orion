# Book Visual Processing App  

### About

This project aims to extract metadata from a photo of a book, and import that information into a spreadsheet for further use. It is designed spefically to anaylize either the Verso of a book (The first page that features the ISBN), or libray assigned spine labels of a book. The format of the information provided will change accordlingly for both options. (For example, A verso analysis  will feature the ISBN, but the spine label will not.). The spreadsheet will either be exported into the phone's file system, or the user can sign into via google to export the spreadsheet directly into Google Sheets.

### Usage 

**For General Use**

1. Start from the gallery page (The app is opened on this page)
2. Enter the camera tab located on the bottom right side
3. Select Verso or Spine Label
4. Take a clear picture of the totality of the book's verso/Spine Label.
5. Confirm and repeat for the rest of the books
6. Once finished, Go back to the gallery and make sure you are in the correct gallery (Either Verso or Spine Label)
7. All New photos are automaticlly selected. Verify your selection and press export
8. Either export via Google docs or onto the phone directly.
9. Keep in mind that the LLM used for image anaylsis can make mistakes. Each item has a attached confindence level, for Items under 90 % confidnece it is recommended to verify the information. 



### For future devlopers

This project was created using the React Native framework, Expo bundler,  and primarly the Typescript language. The github respiratory link is:
https://github.com/Cyiox/Orion

Every file within the "App" directory is commented, however they are a few additional things to note.

In order to test the project on your own device, you need to install the following packages via NPM

- react-native-safe-area-context
- @google/genai
- expo-router
- expo-camera
- @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
- expo-file-system

Run the command `npm install <Package Name>` in order to install all of them.

Currently the code is only compatable with Google made LLMs, the model of which can be changed in the photoview.tsx file on line 41. In the future models from different company's  can be used  by implementing  the OpenAI API instead of googles own

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
